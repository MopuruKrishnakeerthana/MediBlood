# MediBlood
Mediblood is afull-stack web application created from my own idea to support healthcare using technology. It provides 24/7 medicine ordering and blood request services with order tracking, offline support, and a single-page UI, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js core modules.
