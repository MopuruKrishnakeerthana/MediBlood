# MediBlood Delivery (Demo)

This folder contains a **prototype** ordering UI for:
- **Medicine delivery** (catalog → cart → checkout)
- **Blood requests** (type + units + hospital)

## Run

From the project root:

```bash
node server.js
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:5173/mediblood/
```

## Notes (important)

- This is a **demo**. Real medicine and blood distribution must follow local laws, prescriptions, licensed-provider rules,
  matching/testing, cold-chain requirements, and privacy/security standards.
- The admin list (`Admin` tab) works only from the same computer (localhost).
